# In this repo I'm going to Include source code for creating threads and processes.

## Process 
A process is program in its execution state.
Concept of Process has two facets.

A Process is:
A Unit of resource ownership:

1. A virtual address space for the process image
2. Control of some resources (files, I/O devices...)


A Unit of execution:

1. process is an execution path through one or
    more programs 
    2. may be interleaved with other processes
    execution state (Ready, Running, Blocked...) and dispatching
    priority
## Threads
A light weight process which sharres common memory when created.
